    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
       <ol>
           <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan . Add cumin and allow to splutter. The add onions and saute until golden.</li>
           <li>Add ginger garlic and fry for 30 to 60 seconds when they turn fragrant add tomatoes and half tsp salt.</li>
           <li>For until the raw smell goes away.</li>
           <li>Add red chilli powder , turmeric and funnel seeds(optional)</li>
           <li>Fry everything well until the onion masala smells good . Ensure the raw smell has gone . Cool this completely</li>
           <li>fry the merinate fish</li>
           <li>Heat a pan with 1 tsp oil, fry the fish until the raw smell of ginger garlic paste has gone . You can use the same pan used to fry the onions, i used a different one since used a steel pan . Set this aside</li>
           <li>Add the cooled ingredients to a blender jar along with 2 to 4 tbsp of water</li>
           <li>Blend to a coarse or smooth paste to suuit your taste . We prefer coarse texture in our curry so I made a coarse paste . If you prefer a smooth texture make a smooth paste.</li>
           <li>Add another tbsp. oil and heat on a low flame . When the oil turns slightly hot add curry leaves and green chillies</li>
           <li>When the leaves splutter,add the ground paste . Mix everything well</li>
           <li>Sprinkle garam masala and salt . You can add more red chilli powder at this stage to adjust the heat. I added a bit  more.Fry everything well until the masala smells good.</li>
           <li>Pour 1 1/4 cup water and mix well to make lump free gravy. You may need to adjust the amount of water slightly</li>
           <li>On a medium flame boil until the oil begins to separate and the gravy thickens. This may take about 5mins.</li>
           <li>Check the salt  and spice now . Adjust any taste that is needed . If you like to use tamarind, you can saok some tamarind in hot water</li>
           <li>Extract and filter the juice to the gray . We do not prefer  tamarind so I have not used , the sourness from tomatoes is good enough</li>
           <li>Add the fish pieces to the gravy and cook for few mins . Flip them and cook until they are cooked completely . If desired garnish with coriander leaves.</li>
       </ol>
